# Steam dev launcher

Simple stupid wrapper that lets you run your own executable instead of the
regular one. Which is useful when you're developing a game, and want to test
builds from your machine instead of what's currently in your game's Steam
folder.

It tries hard not to panic and logs as much as possible to `launcher.log`,
`stdout.log` and `stderr.log` in the current working directory, which will be
your Steam game's directory when launched through Steam.

## Usage

After installing the app, paste something like this into "Launch Options" in
your game's "Properties" through the steam UI:

```txt
C:\Users\Johan\.cargo\bin\steam_dev_launcher.exe C:/Users/Johan/dev/cargo_space/target/debug/cargo_space.exe %command%
```

On windows, you will see a launcher window with some debug logging for the
launcher. Your game's logs will be in the Steam folder for your game.
